# Desech Studio Plugin list

Adding your plugin here will show up in the software plugin list when trying to install a plugin.

## How to use

- Check the `plugins.json file`.
- Create a pull request by adding your own plugin to the list.
- Only github repository urls are allowed right now for plugins.
- If you want to use a private/local plugin then you can just add it to your Desech Studio plugins folder.
